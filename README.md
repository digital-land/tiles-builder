# Tiles Server

The tiles server consists of two separate deployable images: the server itself and the tile builder task.

## Running locally

To run the service locally run `make application` while authenticated with `aws-vault`. It is advised that you limit the
number of other tasks running and have a minimum of 6GB free space for the required files.

To reset the current tiles stored, run `make clean` before running `make application` to start from a clean slate.

## Building & Deployment

There are two separate GitHub actions [`deploy-application.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-application.yml) and 
[`deploy-task.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-task.yml). Each will run when changes are made to their respective
code directories `./application` and `./task`.
