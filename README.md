# Tiles Server

The tiles server consists of two separate deployable images: the server itself and the tile builder task.

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

this task relies on tipcannoe being installed. this can be installed easily and the commands can be found in their github repo

### Running locally with aws credentials and docker

To run the service locally run `make application` while authenticated with `aws-vault`. It is advised that you limit the
number of other tasks running and have a minimum of 6GB free space for the required files.

To reset the current tiles stored, run `make clean` before running `make application` to start from a clean slate.

### Running tiles building locally withouot aws account

The above is helpful when running with aws credentials and it will launch the datasette app. I have created a temporary solution for producing the tiles locally. This is mainly for on going work and should be reconsidered in the future.

The script can be ran by changing into the task directory and running

```
./build_local.sh
```

## Building & Deployment

There are two separate GitHub actions [`deploy-application.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-application.yml) and 
[`deploy-task.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-task.yml). Each will run when changes are made to their respective
code directories `./application` and `./task`.
